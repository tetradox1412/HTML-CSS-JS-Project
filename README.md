Overview

This project features a timer implemented in JavaScript, along with additional functionalities. Since I was unfamiliar with JavaScript, I found the timer logic challenging and referred to ChatGPT to understand how it works.

However, the rest of the project was built by me after learning the necessary concepts. While I sought guidance from the internet for certain aspects, I made sure to fully learn them before implementing the code myself.

Learning Experience

This is my first GitHub repository, and I am currently in the learning phase. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and GitHub, improving both my coding skills and my understanding of version control.
